# MetroShip

A web-based application that integrates parcel shipping and real-time tracking services directly into the national metro system. This solution will allow passengers and third-party users to send and receive packages conveniently via metro, with full visibility into their shipment's journey from origin to destination. The application will serve as a centralized platform for:
- Booking shipping services.
- Tracking parcels in real-time.
- Managing routes and stations.
- Coordinating metro logistics operations.
